# Cinematic Explorer
Advanced Movie Search Engine written by PHP

# Introduction
Team Gao has one simple goal: to create the best movie searching experience. We truly believe that a good website should be fully accessible to all users no matter if they have visual impairments or use out-of-date devices. That faith leads us to carefully polish each styling detail and maximally optimize the website run-time performance. Our team have been monitoring the website JavaScript performance, removing thousands lines of unused CSS code, as well as massively compress the size of images to make it much more responsive and user-friendly. We have been working dilligently to deliver the best experience to our users, and we highly encourage you to leave any feedback you may have so that we can continue to better our service.

# Team Introduction
Team Gao was started for our Server Side Web Development group project. We were tasked with creating a movie seraching website powered by the OMDb API. Team Gao consists of four members of the Columbus State University Computer Science department: Caleb Corbin, Yujing Gao, Dustin Holmes, and Johnathan Stadtmueller. We have been friends and classmates for most of the time that we have been at Columbus State University. We believe that we work well together and hope that this website is a good representation of such. Read below for a little bit more information about each individual team member.
